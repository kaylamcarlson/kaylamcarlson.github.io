# The Schlaepfer Family Murders
On the 20th of May in 1992, South Auckland was shocked by the brutal act of one farmer against his own family. This man's name was Brian Schlaepfer and he took 6 innocent lives from this world, or 7 lives total if you include him. The victims include his wife, 3 sons, a daughter-in-law and a grandson. After the violence occurred, Brian then wandered into the nearby woods of his property and killed himself. 


## The Schlaepfer Family

The Schlaepfer family name become well known around town after they settled in the town of Paerata. They quickly became well liked within the community. A local road was named after them and still exists to this day. This road sits around 6km away from the family's original farm site. Not much is known about Brian Schlaepfers early life however he was born on September 07, 1927 and by 1992 he was 64 years of age and running the family farm. He married a woman named Jocelyn who was born November 21, 1932. During their marriage they had 3 sons. Peter Wayne Schlaepfer was the eldest and he was born on the 11 of November, 1952. There are less details known about the 2 other sons however the middle son, Karl Percival Schlaepfer was born in 1959 and the youngest son, Darrell Bryan Schlaepfer, was born in 1961. Brian was born into a family with a good name due to their good deeds in the surrounding community. However Brian continued to gather positive feelings towards his family with his own actions. In 1964 a member of the Schlaepfer family along with an outside family donated  two hectares of land which was to be used by the local scouts. This land is located just off Ostrich Farm Road and is a mixture of native bush and large grass areas. After being donated the land was named Schlaepfer Park Scout Camp. The Schlaepfer family has helped the camp out immensely however Brian himself is credited on the camps website with connecting water to the campsite from his own bore. It has been said that he at one point was a volunteer with the scouts as a scout master. The park is still in use today as a campground for everyone and as a wedding venue. There are also some bush trails suitable for anyone to walk. Brian Schlaepfer also founded the local gliding club. It is no wonder everyone in the local community held the Schlaepfer family in such high regard, they used their wealth and land to help those around them whether they be a stranger or family member. 


## The Farm
The Schlaepfer family settled down in Paerata in 1886, which is located just north of Pukekohe and 40 minutes outside of Auckland. The farm was located on Ostrich Farm Road and was over 100 acres in size. The farm was mostly grassy plains however it had wooded natural areas located on the fringes of the property. Three houses were built on the farm and were occupied by 12 people in total including Brian. The first house was lived in by Brian, his wife Jocelyn and their middle son Karl. The eldest son Peter lived in another home with his wife Hazel. They had 2 daughters, Kerry and Linda. Their son was named Aaron. The last house was lived in by Darrell the youngest son. He lived there with his de facto partner and their 2 children. Leadership of the farm was passed through the family and that is how Brian Schlaepfer came to be in charge. As Brian aged he reportedly suffered with deep depression and refused to get help at his family's request. This lead to some doubts over his ability to run the farm efficiently. According to reports, Peter and his wife Hazel then took it upon themselves to talk to other family members to convince them that Brian was too old to run the farm and they should be in charge. It was also rumored around town that Brian was unhappy with changing the farm from pasture into crops as this is how his family farm had run since the purchase in 1886. It's these factors combined with some unknown elements that lead to what happens next...


## Dawn of May 20, 1992
There are conflicting reports about what exactly caused Brian to tip over the edge on this cold morning. The most widely known and accepted theory is that the mounting pressure for him to step down as the farm leader combined with an argument he was having with Jocelyn caused him to lose control. Sometime in the morning before 7:30am is when the entire ordeal occurred. Of the 12 people who lived permanently at the farm only 8 were present on the day. Kerry was having a sleepover at a friends house and it is unknown why Darrell’s de facto partner and their two children were absent from the property that morning. Events that morning start with Brian grabbing a knife and stabbing his wife who was in their bedroom. Of all the ways to kill a person using a knife is considered a very personal murder method, when you stab someone you want to watch and feel them die. Obviously this would cause a commotion in the house, I mean how could you not hear something. 

Karl lived with his parents and was in the same house was the next victim. Karl hears something unusual and gets out from his bed to investigate. While he makes his way to his parents' room, Brian has gone for his trusty shotgun which he keeps in his bedroom, however he also used a .22-caliber rifle and another unidentified gun. Jocelyn lays dead and Brian collects, loads and readys his weapon. Karl barley makes it to his bedroom door before Brian discharges the gun into his neck. 

Hazel at this point hears the commotion going on at the house and decides she needs to investigate the noises. She asks Linda and Aaron to stay in their house while she goes to see what's happening with grandma and grandpa. While this is happening Brian has left his own house and made his way to the properties tool shed. Darrell was in the tool shed dealing with general farm chores. Brian made short work of Darrell by firing into his neck and jaw. This gun shot is loud enough that it draws Hazel's attention and she heads straight towards the tool shed, also heading towards her own death. Brian emerges from the tool shed and fires at Hazel. She is lucky or unlucky depending on who you talk too because she is hit in the arm and chest however, she is not killed instantly. While Brian had to reload, Hazel manages to stumble back into her house. Bleeding profusely and running completely on adrenaline, shock and fear she gets to the kitchen and calls 111. The offical records state the call was made at 7:40am. So far Brian has killed 3 and injured 1 family member in the space of 10 minutes. Keep in mind they live on a rural farm that is 100's of acres large. No one for miles would be able to hear any of the commotion or gunshots. We can only hazard guesses as to how long it would have taken for the police to be notified if not for Hazel making it to that kitchen and placing the call. Hazel gets put through to a Constable Stuck, who she immediately starts pleading with him for help. Brian had loaded his gun, he made his way into their home and for reasons that are unclear to anyone he ignores the kitchen and makes his way to the children. Aaron was still in his bed when Brian approaches him. Reports differ as to how Aaron was killed. Some say he was shot 1 time in the stomach and chest, others say he was stabbed. Either way it is safe to say Aaron died a brutal death and did not deserve what happened to him. Linda whose bedroom was across the hall from her brothers couldn't see what was happening however she could hear Aaron pleading for his life then a gunshot. This caused her to freak out, as I'm sure it would any small child, or adult for that matter. She did the second smartest and bravest thing she would do that day at that moment. She took to her closet and hid, she stayed quiet and listened as Brian made his way into her room. He didn’t even attempt to look for her, a quick once over in her room was enough. He could not see or even hear Linda so Brian turned his attention to Hazel, as he knew exactly where she was. He could hear her talking and screaming downstairs in fear and pain to the Constable on the phone. Brian once in the kitchen finished Hazel off. A single shot to her head. Constable Jeff Stuck on the other end of the phone heard the entire ordeal. The phone hits the ground, however Brian does not bother to end the call or even pick up the phone. After he kills Hazel he makes his way back out to the farms tool shed. He waits for her eldest son Peter to come back from farm chores and then he ambushed him and kills him with either a gunshot or a knife. 

Reports state that after killing Peter, Brian went back to looking for Linda. He knew she was home and tried calling for her. At this stage Linda had moved from the closest to under her bed. At some point after Brian has left the house Linda goes into her brother Aarons room and sees him either dead or in the process of dying. She then does the bravest and smartest thing she could have done on the day by heading to the kitchen. She passes her dead mother, collects the phone and continues the conversation with Constable Jeff Stuck. I won't write the entire transcript of the phone conversation but you can find bits and pieces online if you're so inclined to look for it. The most haunting part of the call however goes like this: 

* Stuck: "What’s happening there, love?"
* Linda: "My granddad…."
* Stuck: "Your granddad…"
* Linda: "He’s shot my brother."
* Stuck: "Your granddad has shot your brother."
* Linda: "Yes, and I think he’s coming to shoot… he’s going to shoot me."
* Stuck: "And he’s going to shoot you now."
* Linda: "He’s looking for me."
* Stuck: "Listen, is Mum there? Can she come to the phone?"
* Linda: "No. Mummy’s dead. He shot her up her nose… she’s just lying there."

Linda under the instruction of Constable Jeff Stuck locks all the doors of the house, and barricaded herself in one of the rooms using any furniture she could move herself. Linda told Constable Stuck her version of the events that had happened. She could still hear talking and said it sounded like someone was trying to get back into the house. Constable Stuck did an amazing job to help Linda. At this stage Brian wanders off into the bush and kills himself with a single bullet. With his death the official death toll of the day was seven. All the victims and their ages are listed in order:

1. Jocelyn Schlaepfer, 55 years old.
2. Karl Schlaepfer, 33 years old.
3. Darrell Schlaepfer, 31 years old. 
4. Aaron Schlaepfer, 11 years old.
5. Hazel Schlaepfer, 42 years old.
6. Peter Schlaepfer, 39 years old
7. Brian Schlaepfer, 64 years old.

## Police response
Constable Jeff Stuck stayed on the phone with Linda for 3+ hours while the police organized themselves and made a plan of attack. He would try and get information out of her as well as let her know important information about the police movements. According to Constable Stuck when she started to realize she may have just lost her entire family he talked with her about her 3 pets cats, school interests, her ballet and jazz dancing, and about how her family had been to the movies the day before. This helped to keep her calm and distracted. By 8am the armed offenders squad or AOS arrived on Ostrich Farm Road. sixty plus officers descended onto the road. They cordoned the area off and had ambulances on standby for when it was deemed safe to enter the property. The police helicopter and Westpac helicopter did sweps of the area and keep an eye from the sky. The Westpac helicopter was providing backup for when the police helicopter needed refueling. At this stage the police are still unaware of just how much blood had been spilt on the farm and that Brian had killed himself. The police have to assume people may still be alive including a possible armed offender. Because of all the unknown aspects of the farm and the situation the police had to approach the house with extreme caution. Linda remained on the phone the entire time with Constable Stuck. They decided together that when the police raided her house they would use the safe word "rabbit" to let Linda know it was the police and safe to open the door. Linda sat in the bedroom barricade in until just after 11am when the police finally knocked on the door, ushered the safe word and recovered the little girl shaken and scared but most importantly safe. After Linda was recovered the police split into teams and surveyed the damage at the farm while also looking for Brian Schlaepfer. Seven hours after the ordeal started the police finally located Brian's body. He was found in a bush-covered gully about 50 yards from the houses.


## Aftermath
Constable Jeff Stuck needs to be commended for his work on the day. He first did what he could to keep Hazel calm before her demise. Then he looked after Linda, keeping her distracted while helping the police to organize the raid. To this day he still can't believe a crime like this occurred in New Zealand and how brave Linda was. At the time of the murders she was only 9 years old. Constable Stuck was quoted saying "She did more than we would want anybody to do … and performed a remarkable feat". To this day we can’t be 100% sure what caused Brian Schlaepfer to snap. There are still questions about his actions on the day. A note was found at the scene by police. They did not and still to this day have never made the contents of the note public. The only clue we got was when asked if it was a suicide note the police responded "It could have taken that form”. All the victims of that day were buried in Heights Park Cemetery and you can visit their graves. Remarkably Brian Schlaepfer is buried alongside the 6 lives he took so needlessly from this world. Years after the tragedy occurred we got some small updates about what happened to Linda and Kerry Schlaepfer who have had to live on with the memory and family name haunting them everywhere they go. Kerry in the aftermath moved away from Paerata and persuaded and career in teaching. Linda, the brave little girl has now grown up and has not publicly commented on anything. Through a close friend she let the press and interested parties know that she wishes to keep the past in the past and just wants to look towards her future. The last known information about Linda is that as of 2007 she had 1 young child, a partner and continued to live in Paerata. There is no details available about what happened to  Darrells de facto partner and their 2 kids. 


## Final Thoughts
The story of the Schlaepfer Family Murder is a tragic and awful one. A once happy and thriving family destroyed within a 20 minute time frame by someone who they loved and trusted. Brian Schlaepfer was clearly distrubed and needed help, however he did not get that help and did the unthinkable. If you look in the right places you can still see the impact the Schlaepfer Family had on the small town of Paerata. Decades of hard work and community building can be destroyed in an instant. However I implore you, if you do come across one of the few remnants of the Schlaepfer family left in that town, please don't think of that awful tragedy. Think of Linda and Kerry Schlaepfer the survivors and the 6 who did nothing wrong yet paid the ultimate price.
