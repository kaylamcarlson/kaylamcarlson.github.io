New Zealand is one of the safest and most beautiful places to live. This is backed up by being a top travel destination for tourists and our low murder statistics. Since 1914 there has only been 66 unsolved murder cases. Today I will be talking about one of the more infamous unsolved cases in New Zealand history. Introducing Jayne Furlong who was better known as Jane Furlong. She was abducted in Auckland on the 26th of May 1993. She was later found murdered and till this day there remains a lot of interest and mystery over the case.
