# The Schlaepfer Family Murder
On the 20th of May in 1992, South Auckland was shocked by the brutal act of one farmer against his own family. This mans name was Brian Schlaepfer and he took 6 innocent lives from this world, or 7 lives total if you include him. The victims include his wife, 3 sons, a daughter-in-law and a grandson. After the violence occured, Brian then wandered into the near by woods of his property and killed himself. 

## The Schlaepfer Family
The Schlaepfer family name become well known around town after they settled in the town of Paerata. They quickly became well liked within the community. A local road was named after them and still exsits to this day. This road sits around 6km away from the families orginal farm site. Not much is known about Brian Schlaepfers early life however he was born on September 07, 1927 and by 1992 he was 64 years of age and running the family farm. He married a women named Jocelyn who was born November 21, 1932. During their marriage they had 3 sons. Peter Wayne Schlaepfer was the eldest and he was born on the 11 of November, 1952. There are less details known about the 2 other sons however the middle son, Karl Percival Schlaepfer was born in 1959 and the youngest son, Darrell Bryan Schlaepfer, was born in 1961. Brian was born into a family with a good name due to their good deeds in the surroundg community. However Brian continued to gather postive feelings towards his family with his own actions to help the small town. In 1964 a member of the Schlaepfer family along with an outside family donated  two hectares of land which was to be used by the local scouts. This land is located just off Ostrich Farm Road and is a mixture of native bush and large grass areas. After being donated the name was named Schlaepfer Park Scout Camp. The Schlaepfer family has helped the camp out immesly however Brian himself is credited on the camps website with connecting water to the campsite from his own bore. It has been said that he at one point was a volunter with the scouts as a scout master. The park is still in use today as a camp ground for the scouts, out door enthusiesta and as a wedding venue. Brian Schlaepfer also founded the local gliding club. It is no wonder eveyone in the local community held the Schlaepfer family in such high regards, they used their wealth and land to help. 

## The Farm
The Schlaepfer family settled down in Paerata in 1886, which is located just north of Pukekohe and 40 minutes outside of Auckland. The farm they ran was located on Ostrich Farm Road and was over 100 acres in size. The farm was mostly grassy plains however it has wwooded natureal areas located on the fringes of the property. 3 houses were built on the farm and were occupied by 12 people in total including Brian. The first house was lived in by Brian, his wife Jocelyn and their middle son Karl. The eldest son Peter lived in another home with his wife Hazel. They had 2 daughters, Kerry and Linda. Their son was named Aaron. The last house was lived in by Darrell Schlaepfer the youngest son. He lived there wth his de facto partner and their 2 children. Leadership of the farm was passed through the family and that is how Brian Schlaepfer came to be in charge. As Brian aged he reportedly suffered with deep depression and refused to get help at his family's request. This lead to some dobuts over his ability to run the farm efficently. According to reports, Peter and his wife Hazel then took it upon themselves to talk to other family members to convince them that Brian was to old to run the farm and they should be in charge. It was also rumored around town that Brian was unhappy with changing the farm from pasture into crops as this is how his family farm had run since the Schlaepfer family the farm in 1886. It's these factors combined with some unknown elements that lead to what happens next...
